## Inspiration
As college students, we have all known the pain of leaving items around campus and having to track them back down. At the same time, often we find lost items around campus, with no way of returning them to their owner. Our app looks to remedy these problems.

## What it does
Lost @ Pitt allows users to drop pins around campus and submit "posts" either:
1. describing an item that was lost in that approximate location
2. describing an item they found in that location
The posts also contain contact information, so the items can be returned to their owners.

## How we built it
We used Flutter to create our app, in order for multiple platforms to be able to use it (web, Android, IOS...). For the backend, we used Firebase as a database to store the information and update the app in real time across multiple devices.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into trouble trying to get images to display after pulling from the database. Images can be uploaded, but at the moment we can't grab those images and tie them back to the posts.

## What's next for Lost @ Pitt
Beautification & fixing bugs!
