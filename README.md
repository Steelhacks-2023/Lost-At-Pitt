**Lost @ Pitt** is a multi-platform, lost and found tracking app, built with **Flutter, Firebase, and the Google Maps API**. It aims to digitize and expidite the process of finding your lost items!

## How does it work?
Users that find items can submit "posts" with a description & location, an image of the item, and contact information in order to return the item to its owner. 

Users that have lost items can also submit posts, allowing other students to contact them if the item is found.

## Current Development
**Lost @ Pitt** is currently in the process of developing a user authentication system and user direct messaging, to move away from using personal contact information as a method of returning items.
